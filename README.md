## DemoApp

### App Description
DemoApp is a simple iOS application. It has a main screen with three buttons, a text field and a text label that displays greetings from the app developer. The first button 'Change Text' is capable of changing the text in the text label to whatever text is provided by the user in the text field. If no text is provided and 'Change Text' button is pressed, the text label displays "GoodbyeðŸ‘‹!". The second button 'Change View Color' changes the 'blue' background color of the app screen to 'orange'. The third button 'Change Text Color' when pressed, changes the color of the text in the text label to black. Touching the screen anywhere outside of the above defined fields results in the reset of the whole screen.
